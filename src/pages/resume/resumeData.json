  "bio": "A makeup artist junior, passionate about creating magic in the world of film and television, excited to enhance my skills and use my craft to aid in the storytelling process. Looking to move into the world of SFX makeup but more than happy to get stuck in where I am needed. I've also recently become a Look Good Feel Better volunteer, helping those fighting cancer to feel good about themselves using the power of makeup. I've also been accepted as BAFTA scholar for 2025/26.",
